# Resourcing of Coal Ash Wastes for Decarbonized Infrastructure Materials

## Introduction

Every year, people make more than 4 billion tons of cement for building roads, bridges, and buildings. This process creates a lot of pollution, especially in the United States. To reduce this pollution, scientists are looking for new ways to make cement that don't create as much pollution. One idea is to use waste materials from burning coal, called coal ash, to make cement. This can lower the pollution created and help meet the growing demand for building materials that don't add to pollution.

This research aims to find ways to use coal ash waste for building materials by identifying and addressing the main problems that prevent its full use. These problems include 
- not knowing the composition of the ash, the ash having different compositions, and 
- not knowing what type of building materials can be made from lower quality ash. 

The research team will create a database of coal ash disposal sites in the U.S. and use it to evaluate the potential for using the ash in building materials. We will also look at the environmental costs and benefits of using the ash. The team's findings will be used to create a new way of designing building materials made from coal ash waste in the future.

## Goals

This research aims to find out how much coal ash waste can be used in building materials like concrete and mortar. Using coal ash in building materials can be good for the environment and can reduce the need for other materials. The research team will use data to try and figure out the chemical properties of the ash and how it can be used in building materials.

### Specific Aim 1

This research project aims to **create a dataset of coal ash waste and its chemical properties** at the disposal sites of coal-fired power plants. The team will use data from a database called the [Carbon Ore Resources Database (CORD)](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/925daa29f2ed44fb808b1d388689b382) and other sources to gather information on coal resources, production, and shipments to power plants. They will also include historical data dating back to the 1970s to get a more complete picture of the coal ash waste. The team may also share the updated dataset in an article if they make enough progress.

### Specific Aim 2

The research team will study **how much coal ash waste can be used in building materials and where it can be found**. They will look at the chemical properties of the ash and see if it meets the requirements for building materials. They will also see where the ash is located in the U.S. and if it's available in that area. As a stretch goal, the team will try to predict how the ash will affect the environment by looking at the chemicals in the ash and comparing it to data on groundwater quality at ash waste sites.
